				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The visualization shows how new U.S. Covid cases have changed over time and generally decreased in the warmer months and increased in the colder months.</li>
				<li>The article mentions how there may be delays in reporting cases around the December holidays and this may have contributed to the increased spikes in early January 2021 and 2022.</li>
				<li>While the first Covid vaccine came out in December 2020, more people had access to vaccinations in mid-2021, which may explain the dip in cases in the visualization around the summer of 2021, since many more people were recently vaccinated.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				While the visualization allows for interesting comparisons between months over a two year 
				period in a circular structure, it is challenging to understand the scale and larger context 
				of Covid-19 in the United States through the visualization. The main focus of the visualization 
				is how the number of Covid-19 cases have increased in winter and there is the largest opening 
				for the first few days of January 2022. The widening red area coupled with the arrow suggests that 
				there will be much further expansion; however, the cases significantly decreased in February 2022. 
				The overall effect of the current visualization is immediate concern around the newest variant of 
				Covid-19 and a spike in cases in January. However, as the New York Times Opinion piece suggests, 
				there was a lot of uncertainty over the future number of Covid-19 cases and the disease was much less 
				dangerous with fewer hospitalizations and deaths because of vaccines and the nature of viruses 
				making the trade-off of transmissibility at the expense of strength. While it is helpful to provide 
				information about the rising case numbers, it is also necessary to contextualize the data, so readers 
				know there is uncertainty about the number of future cases with the Omicron variant and need for less 
				severe action to curb the spike in January 2022 as opposed to January 2021. 
				<br><br>
				There are several components that make it hard to understand the scale of the U.S. Covid-19 cases. 
				The key provides scale information by showing a representation of 150K cases; however, it is hard to 
				compare the areas directly between the scale and larger visualization.  The choice of two red lines, 
				a black line in the center, and the area shaded in red makes it seem as though there is important and 
				different information on both sides of the black line; however, it is the same. There is no additional
				 information about what the points represent aside from a label for a “7-day average” and it would be 
				 helpful to know how many points are within each month creating the lines. Overall, the visualization 
				 effectively communicates the trend of Covid cases increasing around winter (especially January) and 
				 decreasing in the summer, but additional clarifying information could make the scale, context, and 
				 uncertainty more clear.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The goal was to better show the scale of the number of cases by plotting the number of cases on the y-axis as opposed to showing the scale through area.</li>
				<li>By grouping the number of cases into seasons and using color to distinguish years, the aim was to more directly compare the seasonal variation of Covid-19 across time. While there is a jump in the winter, there isn’t a clear trend, and it might be better to break the data back up into month aggregates to understand more nuances over time.</li>
				<li>There is still a need to add more context in this chart, such as the number of deceased people due to Covid-19 to show the severity in addition to the transmissibility.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to explore the design space of circular representations and see if there was a way to keep a similar shape as the original visualization for easy month to month comparisons, while providing a better perspective on scale.</li>
				<li>There are three rings representing each year (2020, 2021, and 2022) and they have the same scale 0 - 6 million cases with an extra jut out for the roughly 20 million cases in January 2020, which emphasizes the Omicron spike.</li>
				<li>Additionally, I broke this sketch into months to show more variation and detail into changes over time.</li>
				<li>However, there is still a need to add more context into the severity of Covid-19 over time.</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>To better understand the context of Covid-19, such as how the danger or severity was impacted, over time, I plotted the number of cases with color indicating Covid-19 related deaths. This allows for insight into how there is a serious concern of Covid-19 cases with the Omicron spike, but there is also uncertainty over the impact, since it is less deadly, but still prevalent.</li>
				<li>I also wanted to convey a more person-oriented visualization by using circles to represent each million people that are impacted as opposed to aggregating everyone into one dot or area.</li>
				<li>Some drawbacks are that it may still be difficult to compare the number of Covid-related deaths over time, since I used a rainbow as opposed to a gradient scale, and by rounding to the nearest million some groups have zero when there were more than zero Covid cases, which could hide the scale of the problem.</li>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				My goal for the final visualization was to show how cases changed over time, especially how cases 
				peaked in January 2022, while adding context about the uncertainty of the future effect of Covid-19. 
				I started with sketch #3 and plotted the data in 
				Tableau as a dot plot with each datapoint representing the sum of new confirmed cases and color 
				representing the number of new deceased. I noticed some points were negative for the number of new 
				confirmed cases and new deceased and removed them, since it is not possible to have negative cases or 
				deceased people. I also noticed there was only one data point for December 2022 and only half the month 
				of September, so I excluded them by choosing to end the visualization in June 2022. I used half of a 
				year instead of ¾ of a year to highlight the January trend that was the focus of the original 
				visualization. I separated each year through a gray box with white space in between, such that each year 
				would be visually grouped to facilitate easier between year comparisons. I also chose a gradient as opposed to 
				the rainbow in sketch #3 to better show the change in the number of Covid-19 related deaths over time. 
				<br><br>
				Then I used the Tableau dot plot of the U.S. Covid  cases and related deaths over time to create a visualization in 
				Figma that had circles representing each million cases because I wanted to create a more person-oriented 
				visualization that conveyed the scale and effect of Covid-19 on human lives and put more emphasis on the humans 
				behind the numbers. To adapt from sketch #3, I 
				added small circles when there were less than 500,000 cases to show that they were not zero and larger circles 
				when there were greater than 500,000 cases. Each month had the number of circles corresponding to the number of 
				cases rounded to the nearest million. I added this information in the key to provide more context for the reader. 
				I kept the y-axis labels, so the viewer can quickly tell the scale and number of people without having to 
				count each circle. I also provided annotations on January 2020 and 2021 to highlight these peaks as well 
				as show the actual numbers of confirmed cases and Covid-19 related deaths and that they were rounded to 
				mitigate confusion. I hoped to convey how Covid-19 was still prevalent in 2022, while contextualizing it 
				with information about Covid-19 related deaths and when the first vaccine came out to help explain the 
				trends and importance of interventions to help people stay healthy. However, by using the number of 
				newly deceased people for color, it may overemphasize points that have more cases. It might have been 
				better to use a ratio of the number of people that died from Covid-19 of the confirmed cases, but I did not have 
				access to this data, since I wasn’t sure which month the newly deceased people first got Covid-19.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        My final design aimed to address my critique of the original visualization regarding the need for more 
		context and sense of scale. I hoped to keep the elements of time by keeping the month by month comparison, 
		but I plotted points on an axis from 0 to 20.3 million, used the size of circles to represent greater or 
		less than 500,000 cases, and represented each 1 million cases through stacked circles to facilitate a better 
		understanding of scale and comparisons between months. I also addressed my concern about how the original 
		visualization did not show how the virus had become less deadly over time. There is a need to balance 
		communicating the potential spike and severity of the Omicron peak in January 2022 with the information 
		that it is less deadly, so people appropriately respond and take steps, such as getting regularly vaccinated 
		or masking in crowded spaces, while addressing that some of the earlier measures of the pandemic, such as 
		lockdowns, are no longer as necessary. I also provided an annotation for when the vaccine came out to show how that may have 
		impacted the severity and deadliness of cases over time. There is still room to add more detail about other events, 
		such as when boosters came out or mask mandates changed, to add further context. Additionally, uncertainty 
		of severity of future Covid-19 cases at the time could be better addressed by adding researchers' 
		predictions of future cases at the time in unfilled circles, but there is a chance this could have further 
		complicated the message. Ultimately, I wanted to focus on timelines, scales, and the humans behind the datapoints 
		at the expense of providing more context and understanding of uncertainty.
