				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The visualization shows how new U.S. Covid cases have changed over time and generally decreased in the warmer months and increased in the colder months.</li>
				<li>The article mentions how there may be delays in reporting cases around the December holidays and this may have contributed to the increased spikes in early January 2021 and 2022.</li>
				<li>While the first Covid vaccine came out in December 2020, more people had access to vaccinations in mid-2021, which may explain the dip in cases in the visualization around the summer of 2021, since many more people were recently vaccinated.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				While the visualization allows for interesting comparisons between months over a two year 
				period in a circular structure, it is challenging to understand the scale and larger context 
				of Covid-19 in the United States through the visualization. The main focus of the visualization 
				is how the number of Covid-19 cases have increased in winter and there is the largest opening 
				for the few days of January 2022. The widening red area coupled with the arrow suggests that 
				there will be much further expansion; however, the cases significantly decreased in February 2022. 
				The overall effect of the current visualization is immediate concern around the newest variant of 
				Covid-19 and a spike in cases in January. However, as the New York Times Opinion piece suggests, 
				there was a lot of uncertainty over the future number of Covid-19 cases and the disease was much less 
				dangerous with fewer hospitalizations and deaths because of vaccines and the nature of viruses 
				making the trade-off of transmissibility at the expense of strength. While it is helpful to provide 
				information about the rising case numbers, it is also necessary to contextualize the data, so readers 
				know there is uncertainty about the number of future cases with the Omicron variant and need for less 
				severe action to curb the spike in January 2022 as opposed to January 2021. 
				<br><br>
				There are several components that make it hard to understand the scale of the U.S. Covid-19 cases. 
				The key provides scale information by showing a representation of 150K cases; however, it is hard to 
				compare the areas directly between the scale and larger visualization.  The choice of two red lines, 
				a black line in the center, and the area shaded in red makes it seem as though there is important and 
				different information on both sides of the black line; however, it is the same. There is no additional
				 information about what the points represent aside from a label for a “7-day average” and it would be 
				 helpful to know how many points are within each month creating the lines. Overall, the visualization 
				 effectively communicates the trend of Covid cases increasing around winter (especially January) and 
				 decreasing in the summer, but additional clarifying information could make the scale, context, and 
				 uncertainty more clear.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="v1.png" alt="line chart of U.S. Covid-19 cases over time" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
					The number of U.S. Covid-19 cases are displayed over a two year span with points representing the sum of cases in each season. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The goal was to better show the scale of the number of cases by plotting the number of cases on the y-axis as opposed to showing the scale through area.</li>
				<li>By grouping the number of cases into seasons and using color to distinguish years, the aim was to more directly compare the seasonal variation of Covid-19 across time. While there is a jump in the winter, there isn’t a clear trend, and it might be better to break back up into month aggregates to understand more nuances over time.</li>
				<li>There is still a need to add more context in this chart, such as the number of deceased people due to Covid-19 to show the severity in addition to the transmissibility.</li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to explore the design space of circular representations and see if there was a way to keep a similar shape as the original visualization for easy month to month comparisons, while providing a better perspective on scale.</li>
				<li>There are three rings representing each year (2020, 2021, and 2022) and they have the same scale 0 - 6 million cases with an extra jut out for the 20.3 million cases in January 2020, which emphasizes the Omicron spike.</li>
				<li>Additionally, I broke this sketch into months to show more variation and detail into changes over time.</li>
				<li>However, there is still a need to add more context into the severity of Covid-19 over time.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="v2.png" alt="Dot plot of U.S. Covid cases and Covid-related deaths over time" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
					The number of U.S. Covid-19 cases are shown over a two year span with each circle representing 1 million cases and the color representing the number of Covid-19 related deaths. The sum of cases each month are rounded to the nearest million. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>To better understand the context of Covid-19, such as how the danger or severity was impacted, over time, I plotted the number of cases with color indicating Covid-19 related deaths. This allows for insight into how there is a serious concern of Covid-19 cases with the Omicron spike, but there is also uncertainty over the impact, since it is less deadly, but still prevalent.</li>
				<li>I also wanted to convey a more person-oriented visualization by using circles to represent each million people that are impacted as opposed to aggregating everyone into one dot or area.</li>
				<li>Some drawbacks are that it may still be difficult to compare the number of Covid-related deaths over time, since I used a rainbow as opposed to a gradient scale, and by rounding to the nearest million some groups have zero when there were more than zero Covid cases, which could hide the scale of the problem.</li>
