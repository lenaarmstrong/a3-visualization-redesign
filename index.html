				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The visualization shows how new U.S. Covid cases have changed over time and generally decreased in the warmer months and increased in the colder months.</li>
				<li>The article mentions how there may be delays in reporting cases around the December holidays and this may have contributed to the increased spikes in early January 2021 and 2022.</li>
				<li>While the first Covid vaccine came out in December 2020, more people had access to vaccinations in mid-2021, which may explain the dip in cases in the visualization around the summer of 2021, since many more people were recently vaccinated.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				While the visualization allows for interesting comparisons between months over a two year 
				period in a circular structure, it is challenging to understand the scale and larger context 
				of Covid-19 in the United States through the visualization. The main focus of the visualization 
				is how the number of Covid-19 cases have increased in winter and there is the largest opening 
				for the few days of January 2022. The widening red area coupled with the arrow suggests that 
				there will be much further expansion; however, the cases significantly decreased in February 2022. 
				The overall effect of the current visualization is immediate concern around the newest variant of 
				Covid-19 and a spike in cases in January. However, as the New York Times Opinion piece suggests, 
				there was a lot of uncertainty over the future number of Covid-19 cases and the disease was much less 
				dangerous with fewer hospitalizations and deaths because of vaccines and the nature of viruses 
				making the trade-off of transmissibility at the expense of strength. While it is helpful to provide 
				information about the rising case numbers, it is also necessary to contextualize the data, so readers 
				know there is uncertainty about the number of future cases with the Omicron variant and need for less 
				severe action to curb the spike in January 2022 as opposed to January 2021. 
				<br><br>
				There are several components that make it hard to understand the scale of the U.S. Covid-19 cases. 
				The key provides scale information by showing a representation of 150K cases; however, it is hard to 
				compare the areas directly between the scale and larger visualization.  The choice of two red lines, 
				a black line in the center, and the area shaded in red makes it seem as though there is important and 
				different information on both sides of the black line; however, it is the same. There is no additional
				 information about what the points represent aside from a label for a “7-day average” and it would be 
				 helpful to know how many points are within each month creating the lines. Overall, the visualization 
				 effectively communicates the trend of Covid cases increasing around winter (especially January) and 
				 decreasing in the summer, but additional clarifying information could make the scale, context, and 
				 uncertainty more clear.
